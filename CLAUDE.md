## Core Features Implementation

### 1. Journal Entry Editor (Primary Interface)
**Description**: The main writing interface where users compose journal entries.

**Key Components**:
- Large textarea/contenteditable div for writing
- Real-time character/word count
- Auto-save functionality (saves draft every 30 seconds)
- Optional title field (if empty, displays date when saved)
- Automatic date/time capture on entry creation

**AI Integration**:
- **Coherence Enhancement**: After user finishes writing, they can trigger AI rewriting to make the entry more coherent while preserving their voice and meaning
- **Dynamic Question Generation**: When user pauses typing (2-3 seconds of inactivity), AI generates contextual questions like:
  - "How did that make you feel?"
  - "What details about [mentioned event] stand out to you?"
  - "What were you thinking in that moment?"
- Questions appear in a subtle sidebar or floating panel
- Clicking a question inserts it into the entry or opens a prompt for the user to respond
- Questions are non-intrusive and can be dismissed

**Technical Implementation**:
- Typing detection with debounce/throttle to trigger question generation
- API call to Gemini with context: "Based on this journal entry excerpt: [text], generate 2-3 thoughtful questions to help the writer reflect deeper or add more detail. Return as JSON array."
- Separate API call for coherence rewriting: "Rewrite this journal entry to be more coherent while maintaining the author's voice, tone, and all key details: [text]"

### 2. Date and Time Management
**Data Structure**:
```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  title: "Optional Title",
  content: "Journal entry content...",
  rawContent: "Original content before AI enhancement",
  createdAt: "2025-10-10T14:30:00.000Z",
  updatedAt: "2025-10-10T14:35:00.000Z",
  date: "2025-10-10", // For calendar lookups
  displayTitle: "Title or formatted date"
}
```

**Display Logic**:
- If title exists: Show title as heading
- If no title: Show formatted date (e.g., "Thursday, October 10, 2025")
- Entry list shows most recent entries first
- Calendar view shows entries by date

### 3. Calendar View
**Description**: Visual calendar interface to browse and access journal entries by date.

**Features**:
- Monthly calendar grid view
- Days with entries are highlighted/marked (e.g., with a cosmic star icon)
- Click on a date to view/edit that day's entry
- If no entry exists, clicking opens a new entry for that date
- Navigation between months/years
- Quick jump to "today"

**Technical Implementation**:
- Use vanilla JS or lightweight library for calendar rendering
- Query entries by date range to highlight days
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop

### 4. Custom AI Instructions (Settings)
**Description**: User-configurable settings for AI behavior.

**Settings Include**:
- **Writing Style**: Formal, casual, poetic, straightforward, etc.
- **Tone Preferences**: Encouraging, neutral, reflective, analytical
- **Custom Instructions**: Freeform text field where user can specify:
  - "Always maintain a poetic style"
  - "Focus on emotional depth"
  - "Keep entries concise"
  - "Emphasize gratitude themes"
- **Question Frequency**: How often AI generates questions (always, sometimes, never)
- **Auto-enhance**: Toggle for automatic coherence enhancement on save

**Technical Implementation**:
- Store settings in local storage or user preferences file
- Prepend custom instructions to all AI API calls
- Example prompt structure: "[User's custom instructions]. Now, [specific task like rewrite or generate questions]. Entry: [text]"

### 5. Theme System
**Light/Dark Mode**:
- Toggle switch in UI (moon/sun icon)
- Persists selection in localStorage
- Smooth transitions between modes

**Color Themes** (Cosmic variants):
- **Nebula Purple** (default): Deep purples, magentas, cosmic blues
- **Starlight Blue**: Blues, teals, silver highlights
- **Galaxy Gold**: Deep space blacks with gold/amber accents
- **Aurora Green**: Dark backgrounds with green/teal northern lights effect
- **Cosmic Rose**: Deep space with rose/pink nebula colors

**Design Elements**:
- Subtle animated star field background (CSS or canvas)
- Gradient overlays mimicking nebulae
- Glowing buttons and borders
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Glassmorphism effects for panels and cards

### 6. Additional Features for Well-Designed App

**Search Functionality**:
- Full-text search across all entries
- Filter by date range
- Tag system (future enhancement)

**Export/Backup**:
- Export all entries as JSON
- Export individual entries as text/markdown/PDF
- Import from backup JSON file

**Statistics Dashboard**:

## API Integration Details

### Gemini API Endpoints Used
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash` (fast, cost-effective)
- Base URL: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent`

### API Call Structure

**Question Generation**:
```javascript
POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent?key=API_KEY
Body: {
  "contents": [{
    "parts": [{
      "text": "[Custom instructions if any]. Based on this journal entry excerpt, generate 2-3 thoughtful, empathetic questions to help the writer reflect deeper or add more detail. Focus on emotions, details, and thoughts. Return only a JSON array of questions. Entry excerpt: [last 200-300 characters of entry]"
    }]
  }],
  "generationConfig": {
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "maxOutputTokens": 200
  }
}
```

**Coherence Enhancement**:
```javascript
POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent?key=API_KEY
Body: {
  "contents": [{
    "parts": [{
      "text": "[Custom instructions]. Rewrite this journal entry to be more coherent, well-structured, and polished while maintaining the author's authentic voice, tone, emotional content, and all important details. Do not change the meaning or add information that wasn't there. Entry: [full entry text]"
    }]
  }],
  "generationConfig": {
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "maxOutputTokens": 2048
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Phase 1 (Local):
- API key stored in environment variable (`.env` file)
- `.env` added to `.gitignore`
- Server-side API calls only (never expose key to frontend)

### Phase 2 (Firebase):
- API key in Firebase Functions environment config
- Firestore security rules (even for single user, basic security)

### Phase 3 (AWS Multi-User):
- API keys in AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store
- Proper authentication and authorization
- User data isolation in database
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input sanitization and validation

## Design Principles

1. **User Privacy First**: AI processing is opt-in and clearly indicated
2. **Non-Intrusive AI**: Questions appear gently, can be dismissed
3. **Preserve Authenticity**: AI enhances but never changes meaning
4. **Fast and Responsive**: Local-first approach, optimistic UI updates
5. **Beautiful and Calming**: Cosmic theme creates peaceful journaling environment
6. **Accessible**: Keyboard shortcuts, proper contrast ratios, screen reader support
7. **Offline Capable**: Core writing functionality works without internet (Phase 1)

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Why Vanilla JS?**: Simpler deployment, no build process, faster initial load
2. **Why Express?**: Lightweight, flexible, easy to migrate to serverless later
3. **Why Gemini 2.5 Flash?**: Fast response times (critical for real-time questions), cost-effective, high quality
4. **Why Local-First?**: User owns their data, works offline, no infrastructure needed initially
5. **Why Phased Approach?**: Validate concept locally before investing in cloud infrastructure

## Future Enhancement Ideas (Post-AWS Migration)

- Voice-to-text journaling
- Mood tracking with visualizations
- AI-generated weekly/monthly summaries
- Photo attachments for entries
- Collaborative journaling (shared entries with friends/therapists)
- Mobile app (React Native or Progressive Web App)
- Integration with wearables for mood/activity data
- Prompt library for creative writing
- Markdown support with preview
- AI-powered insights: "You seem stressed lately, here are patterns I noticed..."

## Development Notes

- Start with basic features, iterate based on usage
- Test AI prompts extensively to get the right tone
- Optimize API calls to minimize costs
- Keep UI simple and focused on writing experience
- Regularly back up local data during Phase 1
- Consider rate limiting AI features to control costs
- Monitor token usage for Gemini API calls

## Git Strategy
